Sitting at a dangerously drinkable 7.1% ABV there’s a touch of Munich malt which gives this beer that little extra caramel biscuit bite to compliment the lip smackingly tropical hops. Expect an all out NZ hoppy riot.","abv":7.1,"ibu":65,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/44.png","ph":4.4,"author":"Sam Mason <samjbmason>"}}}
