Each hop addition adds to the intense layers of depth in this red rye IPA. Toasty caramel & cinder toffee from crystal malts, cacao richness from intensely roasted malt and the spiciness of rye. Zesty pithiness from Citra and the robust resin of Chinook. This small batch exclusive brew is up-front intensity matched with twisted complexity. The can features awesome custom art from Joe Wilson.","abv":7.4,"ibu":65,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/54.png","ph":4.2,"author":"Matt Ball <GeordieMatt>"}}}
