Chocolately, robust, warming, laid back and lots of fun - there are plenty of similarities between the two. Bracken we miss you and we hope you like your beer. Long live the original BrewDog.","abv":5,"ibu":50,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/keg.png","ph":4.4,"author":"Sam Mason <samjbmason>"}}}
