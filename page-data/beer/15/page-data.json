A blend of two huge oak aged beers â€“ half a hopped up Belgian Tripel, and half a Triple India Pale Ale. Both aged in single grain whisky barrels for two years and blended, each beer brings its own character to the mix. The Belgian Tripel comes loaded with complex spicy, fruity esters, and punchy citrus hop character.","abv":14.5,"ibu":50,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/15.png","ph":4.4,"author":"Sam Mason <samjbmason>"}}}
