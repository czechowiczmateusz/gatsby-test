On the palate, smooth & fruity espresso, milk chocolate, and warm brandy-soaked currants are in the middle of a high-class dance-off against the spicy and peppery Belgian character. The overall impression evokes malt loaf or ginger cake.","abv":10.6,"ibu":55,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/69.png","ph":4.4,"author":"Ali Skinner <AliSkinner>"}}}
