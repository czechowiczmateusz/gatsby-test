Citrusy. Resinous. Intense.","description":"Pounding a triple payload of the biggest North American hops humanity has devised, braced by a backbone of caramel malt, this beer is deep, astringent and resinous, pushing to the extremes of lupulin thresholds. There’s nothing inscrutable going on; no mystery in the backstory. It doesn’t seek to be understood. A beer incapable of empathy; only hop overload.","abv":9.2,"ibu":125,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/42.png","ph":4.4,"author":"Sam Mason <samjbmason>"}}}
