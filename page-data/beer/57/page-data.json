Full-bodied and compelling, the robust malt base provides an initial layer of honey, cinnamon and biscuity malt sweetness. Soon the Scottish berries are in on the act, a dominating tug of war between sweet and tart with an overbearing zest. As the beer slips back across your tongue the hops demand and definitely get your attention. At 100 IBUs the bitterness smashes into the back of your throat as the resinous, spiced orange peel flavours add depth to the berry fruitiness.","abv":9.2,"ibu":149,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/57.png","ph":4.4,"author":"Sam Mason <samjbmason>"}}}
