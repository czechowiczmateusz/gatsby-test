Understated that is unless you hop the living daylights out of a beer with it. This is Bramling Cross re-invented and re-imagined, and shows just what can be done with English hops if you use enough of them. Poor Bramling Cross normally gets lost in a woeful stream of conformist brown ales made by sleepy cask ale brewers. But not anymore. This beer shows that British hops do have some soul, and is a fruity riot of blackberries, pears, and plums. Reminds me of the bramble, apple and ginger jam my grandmother used to make.","abv":7.5,"ibu":75,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/10.png","ph":4.4,"author":"Sam Mason <samjbmason>"}}}
