We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. Pilsner yeast ferments with no fruity esters or spicy phenols, although it can add a hint of butterscotch.","abv":6.3,"ibu":55,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/4.png","ph":4.4,"author":"Ali Skinner <AliSkinner>"}}}
