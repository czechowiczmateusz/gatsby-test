The Belgian yeast strain introduces a whole new dimension to the Imperial Stout style resulting in a beer that resembles a marshmallow toasted on a smouldering barbeque then smothered in dark chocolate. Massively seductive and encapsulating this blacker than midnight beer pours with coffee brown head so thick you could almost stand on it, and with an epic lacing on your glass.","abv":12.5,"ibu":40,"image":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/32.png","ph":4.4,"author":"Sam Mason <samjbmason>"}}}
